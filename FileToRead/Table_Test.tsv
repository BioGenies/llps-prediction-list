Predicts protein regions that are disordered, and which subset of those can undergo phase separation. ParSe version 2 (v2), uses sequence hydrophobicity to distinguish folded from ID and, subsequently, polymer scaling exponent (vmodel) and a conformational (hydrodynamic size) parameter to distinguish ID from PS ID. RF classifier trained on different sequence features of PSPs (sequence-based calculations of hydrophobicity, alpha-helix, polymer scaling model) predicting regions prone to undergo phase separation. 	Two negative sets were used: folded proteins and IDRs from DisProt and BMRB, similar in mean vmodel and mean beta-turn propensity.  Positive PSPs came from PhaSePro and DisProt, confirmed as disordered by MetaPredict and non-homologous to PDB entries.  IDPs from BMRB were only labeled as PSPs if phase separation was explicitly reported (NMR at >100 μM).  Redundancy was reduced using PISCES at a 50% threshold.

PASTA+PScore	10.3390/biom12121771	2022	4	Biomolecules	Model combining pi–pi interaction potential (PScore) and beta-pairing propensity (PASTA) to predict proteins' likelihood to undergo LLPS.	Model combining ability to form pi-pi interactions (PScore) with propensity to stabilize B-pairing interaction mode, formed in the amyloid aggregates (PASTA energy density) to predict proteins' propensity to undergo LLPS. Their main insight is that phase-separating sequences tend to favor weaker, shorter beta-pairings, which help maintain the dynamic, entropically stable droplet state rather than forming rigid amyloids. The authors build on FuzDrop’s concept that LLPS is driven by multivalency and stabilized by high conformational entropy. They highlight the role of cross-beta interactions in forming condensates, particularly in LCDs. Authors noted that the interaction energies used in PScore and PASTA represent effective free energies that implicitly account for solvent presence and the entropic nature of hydrophobic interactions. Their results show that combining PScore with PASTA improves predictive performance with respect to PScore. This tool is intended for natural full-length protein sequences from proteomic datasets; predictions for artificial or partial sequences are unvalidated extrapolations.	The positive set consisted of the "LLPS dataset" and "PP dataset" as a subset of the first one. "LLPS dataset" as compiled in FuzDrop (REV and LPS-D). The "PP dataset" includes manually curated protein regions from different organisms with experimental validation "in vitro" or "in vivo", sourced from PhaSePro and used as positive set for development and training of PScore. The negative sets were also sourced from FuzDrop, specifically: "hsnLLPS" with sequences from Swiss-Prot human proteome after excluding the positives, and the "nsLLPS" set including sequences from different species to reflect organism composition of teh "LLPS dataset".

LLPhyScore	10.3390/biom12081131	2022	46	Biomolecules	Genetic algorithm using NN predicting LLPS propensity and the interactions’ contribution to LLPS based on 16 weighted features.	 It considers 8 different interactions or features’ contributions (protein-water, protein carbon, hydrogen bond long-range, pi-pi long-range, disorder long-range, k-beta similarity, disorder short-range, electrostatic short-range) to LLPS, and the data was collected from PhaSepDB, LLPSDB, PhaSePro.	The positive dataset consists of sequences shown to undergo PS on their own in vitro (scaffolds), compiled through manual curation of 142 publications from 2013 to 2019. Databases such as LLPSDB, PhaSepDB, and PhaSePro were not used due to issues like sequence errors and the frequent inclusion of multi-component systems. To reduce redundancy, hierarchical clustering was applied with 50% similarity. For the negative dataset, authors aimed to minimize false negatives, though some compromise was inevitable. Authors filtered out likely phase-separating sequences using CRAPome, an empirical dataset of non-specific interacting proteins. Initially, high-resolution protein structures from the PDB (≤2 Å) were used to define feature sets. Developers also curated a human proteome dataset, removing the top 20% CRAPome hits. For training, a balanced set from both the PDB and the filtered human proteome was randomly selected .

PPT analysis	10.1073/pnas.2320510121	2024	6	Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences	Predicts proteins propensity for phase transition, distinguishing amyloids from droplet drivers (scaffolds), based on sequence. 	A sequence-based model designed to predict a protein’s propensity for phase transition (PT), including droplet formation and amyloid aggregation. The approach fine-tunes the ESM-2 language model and integrates computed biophysical features into a Random Forest classifier. It performs two tasks: identifying phase-transition-capable proteins, and distinguishing between amyloid-formers and droplet-driving scaffolds. Useful to explore the broader spectrum of PT, beyond LLPS alone.	The positive set was divided into 'droplet-forming' proteins (scaffolds undergoing spontaneous LLPS sourced from PhaSepDB, PhaSePro, and LLPSDB) and 'amyloid-forming' proteins from AmyPro, representing core amyloid regions without observed LLPS. The negative set consisted of 360 randomly selected sequences from the 'PDB*' dataset used in DeePhase (K.L. Saar et al.). Redundancy handling was not specified.

The positive set of LLPS-prone proteins was compiled from PRALINE, CD-CODE, Gsponer, BioGRID, DrLLPS, PhaSepDB, PhaSePro, and LLPSDB, filtered with CD-HIT at 50% identity. The negative set included human proteins excluding those in the positive set and their first interactors (from BioGRID), also filtered at 50% using CD-HIT.

Prediction of Phase Transition in disordered proteins	10.1073/pnas.2417920122	2025	19	PNAS	Estimates phase separation of IDRs using SVR trained on CALVADOS 2 simulations to predict transfer free energy and csat from sequence.	A sequence- and quantity-based model to estimate the likelihood of disordered proteins undergoing phase separation. It consists of a support vector regression (SVR) model based on coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations (CALVADOS 2) to predict transfer free energies and concentration saturation for homotypic phase separation from the sequence. Useful to predict phase separation propensity of IDRs leveraging structural information.	Authors generate their own dataset sourced from IDRome and filtered through an active learning protocol to select those that spontaneously PS or not based on their transfer free energies calculation.

PSTP-Scan	10.1093/bib/bbaf171	2025	0	Briefings in Bioinformatics	Predicts self-assembling and partner-dependent phase-separating proteins using ESM-2 and ALBATROSS embeddings, useful for novel protein design.	- Focused on scaffold identification through protein-level and region-level predictions, although it can predict both PS-Self and PS-Part.  - Based on ESM-2 model combined with conformational embeddings using ALBATROSS (MD information). It shows potential for predicting novel-designed artificial proteins. - PSTP offers three specialized sub-models for residue-level phase separation prediction, each trained on distinct datasets: 1) Scan_PS-self targets self-assembling proteins using SaPS data from PhaSePred. 2) Scan_PS-Part focuses on partner-dependent phase separation using PdPS data. 3) Scan_Mix is trained on mixed-type proteins from the PSPHunter "Mix" dataset. Each model outputs regional predictions and a global score (weighted average), requiring sequences with only the 20 standard amino acids.	For self-assembly (SaPS) and partner-dependent (PdPS) PS proteins authors used the curated datasets provided by PhaSePred in their supplementary materials. A total of 201 SaPS proteins, 327 PdPS proteins, and 60220 NoPS background proteins were collected. The developers also used the "Mix" dataset curated by Sun et al. developers of PSPHunter. Sequence redundancy reduction was applied using CD-HIT at threshold 0.40.
